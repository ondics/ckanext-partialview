    longDescription: >
      CKAN extension to enable preview for long `txt` and `csv` files.

      In txt/csv previews this extensions limits the number of lines displayed
      for text files in a CKAN repository.

      This is especially useful for large files such as CSV tables.

      By showing only the first few lines, it keeps the interface clean while
      still providing a clear overview of the file's content.

      This CKAN Extension enables resosurce previews for large `txt` and `csv`
      files.

      Tested on CKAN 2.10 and 2.11
